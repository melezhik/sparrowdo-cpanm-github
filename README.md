      project => "https://github.com/melezhik/outthentic" # GitHub project
      branch  => "realtime-stdout" # Tag name; If not set master branch installed 
  );

# Limitation

If you look more grained control on over CPAN modules install consider [cpan-*](https://github.com/melezhik/sparrowdo/blob/master/core-dsl.md#cpan-packages)
